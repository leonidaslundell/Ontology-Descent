# Ontology-Descent

### Aim 

* Launch a web wizard to cluster hierarchichal gene ontologies or pathways
* Include a local R package (?)
* Have a Bioarxiv manuscript with the web launch (and publish it eventually)

### Collaboration principles

To develop our skills and create something:
  + Set (soft) deadlines to ourselves for completing the task
  + Person doing the task decides their own timeline

  + Responsiveness vs sticking to the plan
  + Our communication vs proccess and tools
  + Working software vs comprehensive documentation
